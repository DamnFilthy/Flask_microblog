# This is my first Flask application.
## This app is microblogging, online personal diary or mini twitter :)

### This application implements:
1. Login and Registration (password hashing)
2. Working with the database (all data is added to the database)
3. Adding posts / editing posts
4. Automatic generation of an avatar via the hash mail - gravatar.
5. Ability to add your avatar (photo)
6. Implemented mechanism - subscriptions / subscribers (friends)
7. Implemented a personal "wall" where you can see your friends' news.
8. Implemented "wall" with news from all users of the application.
9. Implemented password recovery via email.
10. It is possible to open the entire post to make it easier to read, it is also possible to edit and delete your own posts.
11. Time of adding / editing a post
12. It is possible to add a status in your personal account
13. You can see the statuses of other users

You can go to the page of any user and subscribe to it, subscribers and subscriptions are displayed in your personal account.



The system of private messages, likes and comments to articles is <strong> not implemented </strong>, perhaps someday this will appear in my application.
